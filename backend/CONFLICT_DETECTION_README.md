# Railway Conflict Detection System

## Overview

The Railway Conflict Detection System is a real-time algorithmic engine designed to monitor train positions and detect potential conflicts in railway traffic management. The system is optimized to handle 500+ trains simultaneously with sub-second detection capabilities.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **ConflictDetector** (`conflict_detector.py`)
   - Main detection engine with conflict type identification
   - Severity scoring on 1-10 scale
   - Resolution suggestion generation

2. **ConflictDetectionScheduler** (`conflict_scheduler.py`)
   - Background task management
   - Runs detection every 30 seconds
   - Performance metrics tracking

3. **PerformanceOptimizer** (`performance_optimizer.py`)
   - Optimizations for large-scale operations
   - Advanced algorithms for 500+ trains
   - Caching and spatial indexing

## Conflict Types

### 1. Spatial Conflicts (Collision Risk)
- **Detection**: Two trains approaching same track section
- **Algorithm**: Time-based overlap calculation
- **Severity**: High (7-10) for imminent collisions
- **Resolution**: Speed adjustment, delays, rerouting

```python
# Example: Two trains on single track
if section.capacity == 1 and len(trains_in_section) > 1:
    detect_spatial_conflict()
```

### 2. Temporal Conflicts (Safety Buffer Violation)
- **Detection**: Arrivals within 2-minute safety buffer
- **Algorithm**: Sequential arrival time analysis
- **Severity**: Medium-High (5-8) based on buffer time
- **Resolution**: Timing adjustments, holding signals

```python
# Safety buffer check
if arrival_time_diff < SAFETY_BUFFER_MINUTES:
    detect_temporal_conflict()
```

### 3. Priority Conflicts (Express Blocked by Freight)
- **Detection**: Higher priority trains blocked by lower priority
- **Algorithm**: Priority queue analysis
- **Severity**: Medium-High (6-9) for express delays
- **Resolution**: Priority overrides, bypasses

```python
# Priority analysis
if blocking_train.priority < blocked_train.priority:
    detect_priority_conflict()
```

### 4. Junction Conflicts (Multiple Train Convergence)
- **Detection**: Multiple trains converging on junction
- **Algorithm**: Spatial-temporal intersection analysis
- **Severity**: High (7-10) for capacity overflow
- **Resolution**: Sequential scheduling, traffic control

```python
# Junction capacity check
if trains_at_junction > junction.capacity:
    detect_junction_conflict()
```

## Severity Scoring Algorithm

The system uses a weighted scoring system (1-10 scale):

```python
severity_score = (
    time_factor * 0.3 +           # Urgency (how soon)
    train_priority * 0.2 +        # Priority of trains involved
    passenger_impact * 0.25 +     # Number of passengers
    network_impact * 0.15 +       # Network disruption
    safety_risk * 0.1             # Safety risk level
) * 10
```

### Severity Levels
- **1-3**: Low - Minor delays, non-critical
- **4-6**: Medium - Moderate impact, attention needed
- **7-8**: High - Significant impact, immediate action
- **9-10**: Critical - Emergency response required

## Performance Optimizations

### For 500+ Trains

1. **Bulk Data Loading**
   - Single optimized SQL queries
   - Minimal data transfer
   - Batch processing (100 trains per batch)

2. **Spatial Indexing**
   - Grid-based section indexing
   - Fast proximity queries
   - O(log n) lookup time

3. **Parallel Processing**
   - Concurrent prediction generation
   - Semaphore-controlled concurrency
   - Maximum 50 parallel operations

4. **Caching Strategy**
   - 5-minute cache TTL
   - Route caching for frequent queries
   - In-memory data structures

5. **Advanced Algorithms**
   - Sweep line algorithm for spatial conflicts
   - Heap-based priority conflict detection
   - Time-sorted event processing

## Real-time Notifications

### WebSocket Integration
The system sends real-time alerts via WebSocket for:
- High-severity conflicts (score â‰¥ 6)
- Conflicts within 5-minute alert window
- System status updates

### Alert Format
```json
{
  "type": "conflict_alert",
  "data": {
    "conflict_id": "12345",
    "type": "spatial_collision",
    "severity": 8,
    "trains_involved": [101, 102],
    "sections_involved": [205],
    "time_to_impact": 3.5,
    "description": "Collision risk detected",
    "resolution_suggestions": [
      "Reduce speed of train 101",
      "Delay train 102 by 2 minutes"
    ]
  },
  "timestamp": "2025-09-26T10:30:00Z"
}
```

## Database Integration

### Conflict Storage
```sql
CREATE TABLE conflicts (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    conflict_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    severity conflict_severity NOT NULL,
    trains_involved INTEGER[] NOT NULL,
    sections_involved INTEGER[] NOT NULL,
    detection_time TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
    resolution_time TIMESTAMPTZ,
    description TEXT NOT NULL,
    auto_resolved BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
);
```

### TimescaleDB Integration
