## 🔍 Key Queries

### Real-time Train Positions
```sql
-- Get latest position for all active trains
SELECT t.train_number, t.type, s.section_code, p.speed_kmh, p.timestamp
FROM trains t
JOIN positions p ON t.id = p.train_id
JOIN sections s ON p.section_id = s.id
WHERE p.timestamp = (
    SELECT MAX(timestamp) 
    FROM positions p2 
    WHERE p2.train_id = t.id
)
AND t.operational_status = 'active';
```

### Conflicts in Last Hour
```sql
-- Find all conflicts detected in the last hour
SELECT c.*, array_agg(t.train_number) as train_numbers
FROM conflicts c
JOIN unnest(c.trains_involved) train_id ON true
JOIN trains t ON t.id = train_id
WHERE c.detection_time >= NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
GROUP BY c.id
ORDER BY c.detection_time DESC;
```

### Section Occupancy
```sql
-- Calculate current section occupancy
SELECT s.section_code, s.capacity, 
       COUNT(so.train_id) as current_trains,
       (COUNT(so.train_id)::float / s.capacity * 100) as utilization_pct
FROM sections s
LEFT JOIN section_occupancy so ON s.id = so.section_id 
    AND so.exit_time IS NULL
GROUP BY s.id, s.section_code, s.capacity
ORDER BY utilization_pct DESC;
```

## 📚 API Integration

The database integrates with FastAPI for REST API access:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session
from app.db import get_session
from app.models import Train, Position

app = FastAPI(title="Railway Traffic Management API")

@app.get("/trains/{train_id}/position")
def get_train_position(train_id: int, db: Session = Depends(get_session)):
    return db.query(Position).filter(
        Position.train_id == train_id
    ).order_by(Position.timestamp.desc()).first()
```
